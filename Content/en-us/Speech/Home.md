# Bing Speech API Overview

Welcome to Bing Speech API, a cloud-based API that provides advanced algorithms to process spoken language. With Bing Speech API you can add speech driven actions to your apps, including real-time interaction with the user.

Bing Speech API has three components:
* [Speech Recognition API](#SpeechRecognition):  For apps converting spoken words to text.
* [Speech Recognition Intent API](#Intent): For apps that understand spoken words contextually and communicate with people in the way they speak.  
* [Text To Speech API](#TextToSpeech) For apps converting text into audio that can be played back to the user. 

Microsoft's cross-platform REST API enables speech capabilities on all internet-connected devices. Every major platform including Android, iOS, Windows, and 3rd party IoT devices are supported. Our REST API offers industry-leading speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and language understanding capabilities delivered through the cloud.

Microsoft uses Bing Speech API for Windows applications like [Cortana](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/experiences/cortana/) and [Skype Translator](https://www.skype.com/en/features/skype-translator/) as well as Android applications like [Bing Torque](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.bing.torque) for Android Wear and Android Phone.

## Speech Recognition API
Bing Speech Recognition API provides the ability to convert spoken audio to text by sending audio to Microsoft’s servers in the cloud. Developers have a choice of using the REST API or the Client Library. 

### Speech Recognition - REST API versus Client Library
* Using the REST API means getting only one reco result back with no partial results. Documentation for the REST API can be found [here](API-Reference-REST/BingVoiceRecognition.md) and code samples [here](https://oxfordportal.blob.core.windows.net/speech/doc/recognition/Program.cs). Also [here's](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/Node/intelligence-SpeechToText) a code sample of a bot using this API.
*	Using the client library allows for real-time streaming, meaning that as audio is being sent or spoken to the server, partial recognition results are returned at the same time. Real-time streaming is supported on Android, iOS, and Windows.

<a name="Intent"></a>
## Speech Recognition Intent API
Speech Intent Recognition can, in addition to returning recognized text from audio inputs, also return structured information about the speech to apps that parse the intent of the speaker and drive further actions by the app. Models trained by [Project LUIS](https://www.luis.ai/) service are used to generate the intent. To use intent, you will need to train a model after getting an AppID and a Secret. Once you have a trained model, you can use the Speech Recognition API for intent parsing on reco results via the “WithIntent” clients.

<a name="TextToSpeech"></a>
## Text To Speech API
When applications need to “talk” back to their users, this API can be used to convert text generated by the app into audio that can played back to the user. Text to speech conversion (TTS) is done via a REST API. The TTS demo can be found on the [Speech landing page](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/speech-api), documentation for the REST API can be found [here](API-Reference-REST/BingVoiceOutput.md), and code samples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Cognitive-Speech-TTS/tree/master/Samples-Http/CSharp/TTSProgram.cs).
